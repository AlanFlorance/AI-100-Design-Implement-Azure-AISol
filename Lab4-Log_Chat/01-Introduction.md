# Lab 8: Introduction

## Log Bot Chat

### Module: M06-Integrate_Cognitive_Services_with_Bots_and_Agents

In the previous labs, we built an end-to-end scenario that allows users to upload files to a bot and use Cognitive Services to find objects in the images, figure out how those people are feeling, and identify when users are using a language other than English. We then build a Bot Framework bot using LUIS to allow us to understand a variety of queries from our users.

Now, we wish to log bot chats to enable our customer service team to follow up to inquiries, determine if the bot is performing in the expected manner, and to analyze customer data.

This hands-on lab guides you through enabling various logging scenarios for your bot solutions.

In the advanced analytics space, there are plenty of uses for storing log converstaions. Having a corpus of chat conversations can allow developers to:
1. Build question and answer engines specific to a domain.
2. Determine if a bot is responding in the expected manner.
3. Perform analysis on specific topics or products to identify trends.

In the course of the following labs, we'll walk through how we can enable chat logging and intercept messages. We will evoke some of the various ways we might also store the data, although data solutions are not within the scope of this workshop.
